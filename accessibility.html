           We tested the site using Wave, the link to the report can be found <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://nmheg.github.io/FinalExamData1200/index.html">here.</a>  
    </br>     </br> 
           We did run into some troubles when labeling the different forms on the site, and decided to also add a text letting people know to call if they have trouble booking through the form. We made sure to have accessibility as a priority while writing the code and therefore we did not receive many errors while testing the site.

           For general responsiveness and universal design on our pages, we utilized flex containers as our go to display (although we also utilized grids), throughout our coding of our various pages we tested the responsiveness through “inspect” in firefox and tested for various handheld devices. We used the @media function to adjust the page for PC, iPad (tablets) and mobile screens respectively, and adjusted fonts, grids and containers to make them friendly throughout all platforms. We put ourselves in the shoes of vision impaired people, and found our designs and solutions satisfactory. We did that by making conscious choices on backgrounds, font type (Sans-Serif), and font size.

           For picture use: We almost entirely used the open source webpage “Unsplash” for our pictures, we used an URL-solution for this page since it for this task is the easiest solution. The links for the pictures are mostly old and haven't changed, so we hope they won't change for the duration that this assignment will be assessed. If we would have made a real long term webpage of our own restaurant we would not have chosen to source the pictures from URLs from the web, to avoid problems with disappearing images.
